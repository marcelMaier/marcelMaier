### About me
- 🇩🇪 26-year-old engineer based in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
- 👨‍💼 Leading the software development team at KEMMLIT Bauelemente GmbH.
- 🌐 Primarily shipping Angular + NestJS platforms at my company, but looking forward to providing more to the OpenSource Community in the future.

### What I'm up to
- 🛠️ Turning shop-floor challenges into Angular/NestJS applications that production teams can trust.
- 📦 Authoring and maintaining [OpenOptimizer](https://github.com/openoptimizer/openoptimizer)—a Rust detour I took to solve one specific cutting optimization problem end-to-end.
- 💡 Rapid prototyping internal tooling, from data-rich dashboards to automation-friendly APIs, and sprinkling Rust/Axum only for niche performance wins.
- 🤝 Always happy to nerd out about developer related stuff.

### Flagship OpenSource project — OpenOptimizer
OpenOptimizer is my Rust-based cutting optimizer (hosted under the `openoptimizer` org for professionalism) and it keeps production runs predictable when packing rectangular parts.
- Deterministic Best Fit Decreasing heuristic with shelf/remnant tuning for traceable layouts.
- Shared Rust workspace behind the CLI, Axum API, and lightweight web UI, all backed by an OpenAPI spec and sample payloads.
- Clone the repo and run `cargo run -p optimizer-cli -- examples/simple.yaml` to see it in action.

### Toolbox I reach for

### Recent highlights
- `openoptimizer` – Rust-based cutting-stock problem solver to reduce waste in manufacturing.
- `lmstudio-localization` – Community localization work to make local AI tooling accessible worldwide.

### Open-source goals
- Most of my day-to-day builds are internal at KEMMLIT, so I am steadily extracting reusable Angular/NestJS pieces to share publicly.
- Planning to grow OpenOptimizer plus smaller tooling repos so the manufacturing community can benefit from the lessons we've validated in production.
- Always open for collaboration or ideas—reach out if you want to co-build automation-friendly web tools.
